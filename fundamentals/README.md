# üêß Linux Wildcards Cheat Sheet

Wildcards are special characters that allow you to match filenames and strings in commands. They can be used with most Linux commands such as:
```bash
ls
rm
cp

*.txt      # Matches all files ending with .txt
a*         # Matches all files starting with 'a'
a*.txt     # Matches files starting with 'a' and ending with .txt

?.txt      # Matches any file with one-character name ending with .txt
a?         # Matches files starting with 'a' followed by exactly one character
a?.txt     # Matches files starting with 'a', followed by one character, ending with .txt

ca[nt]*    # Matches files starting with 'ca' followed by 'n' or 't' and then anything else

[!aeiou]*  # Matches files that do not start with a vowel

[a-g]*     # Matches files starting with letters a through g
[1-6]*     # Matches files starting with numbers 1 through 6
